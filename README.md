### Binding Transactions

Binding transactions are a way to withdraw money from credit card without user interaction. This can be
used for recurring payments, subscriptions or just to save user's payment method instead of requiring it
every time user willing to make a payment.

To start using binding transactions, first, authorized person, (usually the director of the company) must
send an application using mobile/internet banking and wait until the Bank will approve it.
